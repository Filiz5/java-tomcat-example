    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my web application, powered by Jenkins and deployed on a Tomcat server. It's a pleasure to be part of this journey, creating and managing modern software applications.</p>

    <h2>About Jenkins</h2>
    <p>Jenkins is an open-source automation tool that helps developers build, test, and deploy their software with ease. Originally developed as "Hudson" by Kohsuke Kawaguchi in 2004, Jenkins has since grown into one of the most widely used continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools in the world.</p>
    <p>Jenkins allows teams to automate repetitive tasks and focus on creating high-quality software. It supports thousands of plugins, which means it can be tailored to fit nearly any development environment. Over the years, Jenkins has become an essential tool in the DevOps movement, bringing developers and operations teams closer together.</p>
